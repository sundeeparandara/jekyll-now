My name is Sundeep and this is my blog. 

Looks like Github can host a blog using this called "Jekyll" 🤯...time to find out how well this works!

I am currently working at Airbus ✈ as a Fatigue & Damage Tolerance Engineer - translation, I figure out how aircraft wings crack😱 due to repetitive loading...and do my Dark Arts to ensure they don't crack (too much) 😎

This blog will primarily capture my journey as I morph from a hobbyist coder and machine learning engineer to a more competent one capable of building and deploying production ready models (yes...Skynet is coming 🤖). I hope somewhere down this journey to end up in the field of Virtual Structural Testing or Structural Health Monitoring.

In addition, I will be discussing about other topics that I'm passionate about, which include sci-fi, XBOX, books, finance, exercise and nutrition, hopefully with a bit of code attached to all this. I will be steering clear of Airbus topics, even those that are public domain, for obvious reasons.

Disqus will be soon active, until then, if you would like to contact me:

- Email me at [sundeep.arandara@gmail.com](mailto:sundeep.arandara@gmail.com) 
- DM or Tweet me on [Twitter.](https://twitter.com/ArandaraSundeep)   
- XBOX gamer tag "DubiousRaptor88" (if you want to play Halo 5 or Destiny 2)

Have a good one 👍
