With all the madness and euphoria going on in the markets right now, it is worth taking a step back and establishing some golden rules for investing: 

1. Understand your risk appetite.
2. Understand your investment horizon.
3. Don't invest money you can't afford to lose.
4. Focus on time in market instead of timing the market.
5. Understand the risk-return spectrum and where securities are positioned on this spectrum.
6. You don't control what happens to or inside your basket of investments, apart from the decision of buying, selling or doing nothing.
7. Watch out for transaction fees.
8. Beware of Confirmation Bias and FOMO (fear of missing out).
9. Average retail investors should invest (in securities they understand) and not trade. You are up against quants and more compute power than your bandwidth can handle.
10. Focus on your craft, spend less than you make and invest regularly with respect to the above points.
